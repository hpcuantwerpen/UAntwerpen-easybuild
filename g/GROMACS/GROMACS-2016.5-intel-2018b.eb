GROMACS is a versatile package to perform molecular dynamics, i.e. simulate the
Newtonian equations of motion for systems with hundreds to millions of
particles.

Binaries included:
* gmx: Compiled with support for OpenMP and GROMACS ThreadMPI
* gmx_mpi: Compiled with support for MPI and OpenMP. The built-in ThreadMPI
  support is turned off.
Both binaries are compiled with single precision arithmetic. The binaries were
compiled using standard VSC build scripts, in a way that deviates from the
process suggested by the GROMACS authors.

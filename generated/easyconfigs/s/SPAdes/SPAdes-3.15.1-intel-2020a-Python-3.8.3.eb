SPAdes – St. Petersburg genome assembler – is an assembly toolkit containing
various assembly pipelines. 

The current version of SPAdes works with Illumina or IonTorrent reads and is
capable of providing hybrid assemblies using PacBio, Oxford Nanopore and Sanger
reads. You can also provide additional contigs that will be used as long reads.

SPAdes uses OpenMP, so it is better to set OMP_NUM_THREADS.

gh is GitHub on the command line. It brings pull requests, issues,
and other GitHub concepts to the terminal next to where you are
already working with git and your code.
"""

usage = """
This module works with any version of the git command line program,
so it might be useful to also load the most recent buildtools module
to get a more recent version of the git executable.

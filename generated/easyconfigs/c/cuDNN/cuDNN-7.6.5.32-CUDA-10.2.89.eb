description = """
The NVIDIA CUDAÂ® Deep Neural Network library (cuDNN) is a GPU-accelerate
library of primitives for deep neural networks. cuDNN provides highly tuned
implementations for standard routines such as forward and backward convolution,
pooling, normalization, and activation layers. cuDNN is part of the NVIDIA Deep
Learning SDK.

Deep learning researchers and framework developers worldwide rely on cuDNN for
high-performance GPU acceleration. It allows them to focus on training neural
networks and developing software applications rather than spending time on
low-level GPU performance tuning. cuDNN accelerates widely used deep learning
frameworks, including Caffe2, MATLAB, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit, TensorFlow,
Theano, and PyTorch. See supported frameworks for more details. cuDNN is freely
available to members of the NVIDIA Developer Program

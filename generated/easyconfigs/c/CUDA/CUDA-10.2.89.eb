description = """
CUDA (formerly Compute Unified Device Architecture) is a parallel computing
platform and programming model created by NVIDIA and implemented by the graphics
processing units (GPUs) that they produce. CUDA gives developers access to the
virtual instruction set and memory of the parallel computational elements in
CUDA GPUs.

The CUDA toolkit also includes a number of GPU-accelerated libraries
* CUDA Math Library: For standard mathematical functions
* cuBLAS: GPU-accelerated standard BLAS library
* cuSPARSE: GPU-accelerated BLAS for sparse matrices
* cuSOLVER: a collection of dense and sparse direct solvers
* cuRAND: GPU-accelerated random number generators
* cuFFT: Fast Fourier Transform library
* NPP - NVIDIA Performance Primitives for GPU-accelerated image, video and 
  signal processing functions
* nvGRAPH: high-performance analytics on graphs
* Thrust: an open source library of parallel algorithms and data structures
  for convenience also included in the CUDA toolkit
Other libraries are provided as separate modules.

The CUDA libraries provided by this module are installed from nVIDIA-provided
downloads.

description = """
An all-electron full-potential linearised augmented-plane wave (FP-LAPW) code with
many advanced features. Written originally at Karl-Franzens-UniversitÃ¤t Graz as a milestone of the
EXCITING EU Research and Training Network, the code is designed to be as simple as possible so that
new developments in the field of density functional theory (DFT) can be added quickly and reliably.

Elk was compiled with support for MPI, OpenMP, MKL and Wannier90.

The vimelk command can be used to enable vim syntax coloring.

description = """
DFTB+ is a fast and efficient versatile quantum mechanical simulation
package.  It is based on the Density Functional Tight Binding (DFTB)
method, containing almost all of the useful extensions which have been
developed for the DFTB framework so far.  Using DFTB+ you can carry
out quantum mechanical simulations like with ab-initio density
functional theory based packages, but in an approximate way gaining
typically around two orders of magnitude in speed.

This module only supports OpenMP shared memory parallelism.  Use the
MPI version of the module if you need to scale to more than one node.

The module is compiled with the optional ARPACK-ng support
and the optional components that the installation process downloads
and enables by default.

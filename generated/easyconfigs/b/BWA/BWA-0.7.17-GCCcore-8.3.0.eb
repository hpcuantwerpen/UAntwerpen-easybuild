description = """
BWA is a software package for mapping DNA sequences against a large reference 
genome, such as the human genome. It consists of three algorithms: 
BWA-backtrack, BWA-SW and BWA-MEM. The first algorithm is designed for 
Illumina sequence reads up to 100bp, while the rest two for longer sequences 
ranged from 70bp to a few megabases. BWA-MEM and BWA-SW share similar features 
such as the support of long reads and chimeric alignment, but BWA-MEM, which 
is the latest, is generally recommended as it is faster and more accurate. 
BWA-MEM also has better performance than BWA-backtrack for 70-100bp Illumina 
reads.

For all the algorithms, BWA first needs to construct the FM-index for the 
reference genome (the index command). Alignment algorithms are invoked with 
different sub-commands: aln/samse/sampe for BWA-backtrack, bwasw for BWA-SW 
and mem for the BWA-MEM algorithm.

If you use BWA-SW, please cite:

  Burrows-Wheeler Transform. Bioinformatics, Epub. [PMID: 20080505]

usage = """
BWA also has two perl scripts that should run with the system Perl. It
is however always possible to load a Perl module from a matching 
toolchain (in this case GCCcore-%(gcc)s or intel-%(buildset)s).

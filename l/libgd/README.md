### 2.3.0 for Intel 2020a

* This version was just out when we installed it.
* TODO: It looks like libgd goes searching for some libraries that we do not yet
  include as a dependency or have installed on our system. Check if they can be
  useful. The consequence is likely that it will move further down in the build
  chain.

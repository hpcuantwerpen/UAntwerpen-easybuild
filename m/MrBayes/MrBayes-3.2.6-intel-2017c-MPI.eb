description = """
MrBayes is a program for Bayesian inference and model choice across a wide
range of phylogenetic and evolutionary models. MrBayes uses Markov chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to estimate the posterior distribution of model
parameters.

Program features include:
* A common command-line interface across Macintosh, Windows, and UNIX 
  operating systems;
* Extensive help available from the command line;
* Analysis of nucleotide, amino acid, restriction site, and morphological 
  data;
* Mixing of data types, such as molecular and morphological characters,
  in a single analysis;
* Easy linking and unlinking of parameters across data partitions;
* An abundance of evolutionary models, including 4x4, doublet, and codon models
  for nucleotide data and many of the standard rate matrices for amino acid data;
* Estimation of positively selected sites in a fully hierarchical Bayesian
  framework;
* Full integration of the BEST algorithms for the multi-species coalescent.
* Support for complex combinations of positive, negative, and backbone
  constraints on topologies;
* Model jumping across the GTR model space and across fixed rate matrices for
  amino acid data;
* Monitoring of convergence during the analysis, and access to a wide range of
  convergence diagnostics tools after the analysis has finished;
* Rich summaries of posterior samples of branch and node parameters printed to
  majority rule consensus trees in FigTree format;
* Implementation of the stepping-stone method for accurate estimation of model
  likelihoods for Bayesian model choice using Bayes factors;
* The ability to spread jobs over a cluster of computers using MPI;
* Support for the BEAGLE library, resulting in dramatic speedups for codon and
  amino acid models on compatible hardware (NVIDIA graphics cards);
* Checkpointing across all models, allowing the user to seemlessly extend a
  previous analysis or recover from a system crash;

This module was compiled with MPI support enabled.

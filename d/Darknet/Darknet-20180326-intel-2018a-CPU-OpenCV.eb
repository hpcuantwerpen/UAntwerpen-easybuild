description = """
Darknet is an open source neural network framework written in C and CUDA. It is
fast, easy to install, and supports CPU and GPU computation. 

This module only supports CPU computation and contains config and weight files
for some networks, including for YOLO. The CPU code uses OpenMP parallelism.
This module includes OpenCV support. However, due to the nature of batch
processing, GUI support is not included in OpenCV which will cause crashes
if Darknet tries to open a GUI window.
"""

usage = """
As this is an OpenMP-enabled code, don't forget to select the number of threads
by setting OMP_NUM_THREADS.

Some hints:
- Configuration files are in $EBROOTDARKNET/cfg
- Example data files are in $EBROOTDARKNET/data
- Some weight files have already been downloaded and put in 
  $EBROOTDARKNET/weights
"""

usage = """
See the documentation on readthedocs. Only the documentation of the latest
version is readily available.

Things to know about our local installation:
 - The EasyBuild configuration files that we used are stored in
   /apps/antwerpen/easybuild/config
 - The repository of EasyConfigs for installed software is in
   /apps/antwerpen/easybuild/repo, organised per system architecture
   and major OS release.
 - We maintain GitHub repositories with our EasyConfig files and our
   custom EasyBlocks:
    - https://github.com/hpcuantwerpen/UAntwerpen-easyconfigs
    - https://github.com/hpcuantwerpen/easybuild-easyblocks
 - Note that our UAntwerp EasyBuild installation differs in a number of
   aspects form an installation that you get from the default EasyBuilders
   repositories. Hence you may want to make sure that EasyBuild checks our
   repositories before checking the default ones if you want to build on top
   of modules that we already provide.
    - Specifically, we work a lot with bundles that bundle the functionality
      of several other EasyBuild EasyConfigs/modules into one to reduce module
      clutter.
    - For centrally installed modules we also use our own naming scheme as the 
      subdivision according to moduleclass is often arbitrary and therefore not
      used in practice to limit the modules that one sees.

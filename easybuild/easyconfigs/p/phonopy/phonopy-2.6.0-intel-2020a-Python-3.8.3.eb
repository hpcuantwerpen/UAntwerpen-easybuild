description = """
Phonopy is an open source package for phonon calculations at harmonic and quasi-harmonic 
levels.

The following features of phonopy are highlighted:
 * Phonon band structure, phonon DOS and partial-DOS
 * Phonon thermal properties: Free energy, heat capacity (Cv), and entropy
 * Phonon group velocity
 * Thermal ellipsoids / Mean square displacements
 * Irreducible representations of normal modes
 * Dynamic structure factor for INS and IXS
 * Non-analytical-term correction: LO-TO splitting (Born effective charges and dielectric 
   constant are required.)
 * Mode Gr√ºneisen parameters
 * Quasi-harmonic approximation: Thermal expansion, heat capacity at constant pressure (Cp)
 * Interfaces to calculators: VASP, VASP DFPT, ABINIT, Quantu ESPRESSO, SIESTA, Elk, WIEN2k, 
   CRYSTAL, DFTB+, TURBOMOLE, CP2K, FHI-aims, LAMMPS (external)
 * Phonopy API for Python

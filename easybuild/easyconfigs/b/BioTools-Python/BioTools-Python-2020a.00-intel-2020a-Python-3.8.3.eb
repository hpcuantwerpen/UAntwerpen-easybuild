description = """
This module provides a number of useful Python bio-informatics tools, often
tools that wrap around tools in the BioTools package.

Overview of the included tools and libraries:

* Biopython (version %(biopython)s): a set of freely available tools for 
  biological computation written in Python by an international team of 
  developers. It is a distributed collaborative effort to develop Python 
  libraries and applications which address the needs of current and future 
  work in bioinformatics.
* DLCpar (version %(DLCpar)s): DLCpar is a reconciliation method for inferring 
  gene duplications, losses, and coalescence (accounting for incomplete  
  lineage sorting).
* FLye (version %(Flye)s): a de novo assembler for single molecule sequencing reads, 
  such as those producedby PacBio and Oxford Nanopore Technologies. It is 
  designed for a wide range of datasets, from small bacterial projects to 
  large mammalian-scale assemblies. The package represents a complete pipeline: 
  it takes raw PacBio / ONT reads as input and outputs polished contigs. Flye 
  also has a special mode for metagenome assembly.
* HTSeq (version %(HTSeq)s): A framework to process and analyze data from 
  high-throughput sequencing (HTS) arrays
* pysam (version %(Pysam)s): a python module for reading and manipulating Samfiles. 
  It's a lightweight wrapper of the samtools C-API. Pysam also includes an interface 
  for tabix.
* SICER2 (version %(SICER2)s): Redesigned and improved ChIP-seq broad peak calling tool SICER.
  Chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with high-throughput sequencing 
  (ChIP-seq) can be used to map binding sites of a protein of interest in 
  the genome. Histone modifications usually occupy broad chromatin domains 
  and result in diffuse patterns in ChIP-seq data that make it difficult to 
  identify signal enrichment. SICER, a spatial clustering approach for the 
  identification of ChIP-enriched regions, was developed for calling broad 
  peaks from ChIP-seq data.
  Usability of the original SICER software has been affected by increased 
  throughputs of ChIP-seq experiments over the years. We now present SICER2 
  a more user-friendly version of SICER that has been redisgned and streamlined 
  to handle large ChIP-seq data sets. This new Python package supports multiple 
  job submissions on cluster systems and parallel processing on multicore 
  architectures.

description = """
RAxML-NG is a phylogenetic tree inference tool which uses maximum-likelihood (ML)
optimality criterion. Its search heuristic is based on iteratively performing a
series of Subtree Pruning and Regrafting (SPR) moves, which allows to quickly
navigate to the best-known ML tree. RAxML-NG is a successor of RAxML (Stamatakis
2014) and leverages the highly optimized likelihood computation implemented in
libpll (Flouri et al. 2014).
This version was compiled with support for multithreading and can use only one
node.

Due to bugs and bad decisions in the configuration process of RAxML-NG and its
dependencies, the binaries are suboptimal even on Ivybridge CPUs. Hence the 
package is currently only available on Hopper.

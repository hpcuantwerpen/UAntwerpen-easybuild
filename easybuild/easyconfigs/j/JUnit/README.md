## EasyBuild

-   [JUnit support in the EasyBuilders repository](https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs/tree/develop/easybuild/easyconfigs/j)
    
    
### Version 4.12

-   EasyConfig derived from an older EasyBuilders one.
    
-   Not carried forward to 2022a as Java 1.8 is no longer maintained.


### Version 4.13

-   Not clear from the documentation which Java versions it supports to not yet
    ported. Information I found suggests that JUnit 5 should be used with Java 11.


### Version 5.???

-   Not yet in EasyBuild while working on the 2022a toolchain, so introduction
    postponed until there is a clear need.

# AutoDock_Vina instructions

-   [AutoDok-Vina web site](https://vina.scripps.edu/)



## EasyBuild

-   [AutoDock_Vina in the EasyBuilders repository](https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs/tree/develop/easybuild/easyconfigs/a/AutoDock-Vina).
    Note the different name, maybe because we developed ourselves before it was fully supported in EasyBuild?
    

### Version 1.1.2 for 2020a

-   Simply downloaded binaries and a standard EasyConfig.


### Version 1.2.3 for 2022a

-   Contrary to the EasyBuilders recipe, we still use downloaded binaries.

-   The new download is now itself a single binary, so we needed to write a new EasyConfig.

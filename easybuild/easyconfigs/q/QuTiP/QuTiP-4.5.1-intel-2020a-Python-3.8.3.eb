description = """
QuTiP is open-source software for simulating the dynamics of closed and open quantum 
systems. The QuTiP library depends on the excellent Numpy, Scipy, and Cython numerical 
packages. In addition, graphical output is provided by Matplotlib. QuTiP aims to 
provide user-friendly and efficient numerical simulations of a wide variety of quantum 
mechanical problems, including those with Hamiltonians and/or collapse operators with 
arbitrary time-dependence, commonly found in a wide range of physics applications. 
QuTiP is freely available for use and/or modification on all common platforms. Being 
free of any licensing fees, QuTiP is ideal for exploring quantum mechanics in research 
as well as in the classroom.

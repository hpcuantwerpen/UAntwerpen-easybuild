description = """
OpenFOAM is a free, open source CFD software package. OpenFOAM has an extensive
range of features to solve anything from complex fluid flows involving chemical
reactions, turbulence and heat transfer, to solid dynamics and electromagnetics.

This module contains version %(version)s as distributed by OpenFOAM.org.

As the module has been compiled for the compute nodes, no 3D graphics features
have been included.
"""

usage = """
When loading the module, a minimum of FOAM_ and WM_ environment variables is 
set, enough to easily call the OpenFOAM script that sets the other variables.
In Bash, you can simply execute
  source $FOAM_BASH
after loading the module.

Note though that some variables have values that do not make sense:
  * The FOAM_JOBDIR and FOAM_SITE_* variables point to directories that do
    not exist on our site as we have no site-specific customizations.
  * WM_PROJECT_USER_DIR and therefore also FOAM_RUN and the FOAM_USER_* 
    variables may point to directories that do not exist. You can customize
    those variables at will. (But remember that jobs should mainly run from
    scratch and never from $VSC_HOME!)

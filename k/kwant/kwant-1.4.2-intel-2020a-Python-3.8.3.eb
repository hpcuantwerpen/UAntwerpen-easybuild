description = """
Kwant is a free (open source) Python package for numerical calculations on
tight-binding models with a strong focus on quantum transport. It is designed to
be flexible and easy to use. Thanks to the use of innovative algorithms, Kwant
is often faster than other available codes, even those entirely written in the
low level FORTRAN and C/C++ languages.

Tight-binding models can describe a vast variety of systems and phenomena in
quantum physics. Therefore, Kwant can be used to simulate metals, graphene,
topological insulators, quantum Hall effect, superconductivity, spintronics,
molecular electronics, any combination of the above, and many other things.

Kwant does not use the traditional input files often found in scientific
software packages. Instead, one writes short programs in the powerful yet
easy-to-learn Python language. These programs define a system and calculate its
quantum properties (conductance, density of states, etc). 

Note that the package relies on purely sequential, single-core libraries...
